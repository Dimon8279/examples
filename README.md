# Examples
There is no nothing insteresting in this repository. There are some example files in it.

For example, when I need to test something like Python project, or music file, or image, i can just:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/Dimon8279/examples
```

And I can get different types of files in one command, to test them in fresh-installed OS.
